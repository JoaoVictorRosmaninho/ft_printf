## Thoughts
   - this project reforce the importance of map all allocated memory and ensure it will be freed when possible.
   - this project reforce the importance of being a friend of gdb
   - this project introduces tokenization thinking
   - This project in general was easy, but the major struggling here was avoid memory leaks (all funcions are tested with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/))
